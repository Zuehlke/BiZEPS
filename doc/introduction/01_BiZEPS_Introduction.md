#   Introduction to BiZEPS
##  What's BiZEPS?
- Open Source Zuehlke Embedded Build System
- BiZEPS is a **concept**, not a solution
- More than just a build server
- A modular build system realized with Docker
- Addresses the life cycle and maintenance of the continuous integration
- For Zuehlke and their customers

##  Advantages
- Separation of each tool chain
  - Multiple tool chains in parallel
  - Different versions of the same tool chain in parallel
  - Different versions of libraries in parallel
- Revisions of the build system
- Minimize idle resources
- Minimize risk due to application updates
- Simplify distribution of the build system
- Allows continuous integration of the build system
- High scalability, from single server to multi cloud concepts

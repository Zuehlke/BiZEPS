#   Building DockerCI
This section describes how DockerCI is realized as a step by step documentation.
The documentation reflects the current system state and should not be written in diary style.
If a part in DockerCI is changed the corresponding step should be updated.
The reason why the previous implementation is insufficient should also be documented.

**Reason:**
The content of this document could be used to write one or more bloc articles about DockerCI.
